# Project_M20
Final Project for Team Blue in UC Berkeley Data Analytics Class

## Project Process Overview
The Class instructors divided the class into 3 4-person teams with each team defining their own project within the Rubric provided. The project will run over 4 weeks with defined deliverables due at the end of each week on Sunday. The Rubric can be found in the Master Branch of the Repository. 

## Phase 1 - Project Definition
During the first week, the team will meet during normal class hours on Monday and Wednesday and hold any additional Zoom meetings as determined by the team. The objectives during this first week are to:
1) Get acquainted with team members
2) Choose a project and determine roles
3) Do due diligence on various aspects of the project such as source of data, technology stack, how work will be assigned and tracked. 

## Project Kickoff Meeting
Team-Blue held their first meeting on Monday at 3 pm over zoom to kick off the project and get acquainted. We did a round robin answering such questions as:

* Why did you take this course and what were your objectives
* How are you doing in the course? Challenges, unit tests
* Work experience
* Project experience
* Any particular domain (subject matter) expertise, hobbies, professional
* Any initial thoughts on project ideas and role you want to play
* Best time for you to work on project
* Best time for team meetings
* Can we contact you during the day via text, cell

During the meeting we brainstormed some initial ideas and committed to each come up with 3-4 project ideas and describe them in written form using the template provided in the Rubric as follows:

* Selected topic
* Reason why we selected the topic
* Description of our source data
* Questions we hoped to answer from the data through prediction or classification via ML. 
* With multiple ideas, we would then choose our topic through multi-voting. Round one would reduce 12-16 ideas down to the best
three ideas, then a second vote would select 1 using the other 2 as backup ideas if we ran into problems (data sources, already done before etc). 

Sierra then volunteered to setup our SLACK Channel for Team BLue and this repository. 

## Week 1 Deliverables
Content Team members have drafted their project, including the following:

*✓ Selected topic

* ✓ Takes in data in from the provisional database 
* ✓ Outputs label(s) for input data

Database
Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
